**MVP-  A react app with full CRUDability for users to manage their own recipes. Will also link to a recipe API and allow users to find/save recipes from that database

**Stretch goals:
- allow users to search/filter their own recipes by 1 ingredient, several ingredients
- incorporate another API to show nutritional value
- allow unit conversion for ingredient amounts
- allow photo upload for users to add pics of their recipes
